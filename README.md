# moon

moon is a web application boilerplate written in Go and React ES6. It uses npm and Node.js buildtools extensively during the development process (ie. webpack, babel, react jsx, scss). moon makes it easy to create and rapid prototype Single Page Applications (SPA). When your application is ready for production you can remove node.js as a dependency. 

# Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

moon implements HMR for react and displays error messages in your browser. It combines [webpack-hot-middleware](https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware) and [webpack-dev-middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware) to serve hot client bundles from an HMR express server. The HMR server runs on a separate port from your Go server and pushes updates to the client via CORS.

To update react components it utilizes a stack based on [react-transform-hmr](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr). 
 
_Your Go server will still serve API endpoints and other static assets during hot mode. If you turn off `hot` mode while the servers are running, they will need to be restarted in order to serve the proper bundles._

# Config

moon apps are configured using _toml_.

```toml
[common]	
env = "development" # development|production
static = "static" # Bundles, images, stubs, etc. 
js = "bundle.js" # Auto-prefixed with static 
style = "bundle.css" # Auto-prefixed with static 
api = "/api/" # prefix for api endpoints 
hot = true # enables live reload. env must be development and hmr must be set
hmr = "192.0.0.1:8889" # when hot flag is true the bundle is served via jsonp from webpack server 

[server]
template = "template.html.tpl"
address = "0.0.0.0:8888"
serve = "192.0.0.1:8888"

[client]
entry = "entry.js"
```

# Routing

1. API endpoints - prefixed with the `api` config entry 
2. Static files stored in the directory set in the `static` config entry
3. Default to client routing. If the prior two cases are not satisfied, the server will send the frontend application code. The application takes the form of an html5 template with a link and script tag pointing to the css and js bundles that were output by webpack. (when in hot mode they are served from memory instead) 

On the frontend, assuming the client bundle is served, the routing is deferred to react-router. Routes can be added per component from `/client/entry.js`:

```javascript
const routes = {
	path: '/',
	component: App,
	childRoutes: [
		{ path: 'about', component: About },
		{ path: 'contact', component: Contact },
	]
}
```

# Usage

Make sure you have:

1. Go
2. Node.js (4.0+ recommended)
3. npm

Clone this repo. Enter the root directory and type:

`npm install`

Open up a separate tty and type:

`npm start`

Make sure you have the Go dependencies to run the server. Assuming you have set your GOPATH, just manually install the 3 dependencies:

```bash
go get github.com/Sirupsen/logrus
go get github.com/BurntSushi/toml
go get github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter
```

A simple Makefile is provided to build and run the server:

`make run-server`

Navigate to `http://localhost:8888` and verify that "Hello World!" is displayed.

Check `http://localhost:8888/api/version` to see the endpoint support.

Edit `/client/components/app.js` and see that the code is automatically updated in your browser without a refresh.

# Adding Endpoints

A simple version endpoint is provided in the `/server/api.go` file. You can manage all of your endpoints from this file if you want.

_Endpoints must implement `httprouter.Handle`. In other words they need the same signature as the `VersionEndpoint` function._ 

To add your own endpoint, create a new function with the same signature as `VersionEndpoint`. Then add the endpoint as shown below. 

Endpoints can have parameterized syntax provided by [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter). Just remember that the endpoint will be prefixed with whatever you have set in your config. For example:

```go
s.Endpoint("/user/:id/:action", API_POST, UserEndpoint)
```

Could be reached at `http://localhost:8888/api/user/1/edit`

Note that `API_GET`, `API_POST`, and `API_BOTH` are bit masked in order to determine allowed methods for the router.
